GMU HIST697
Church-Membership is my initial project. It uses a table from the 1926 Presbyterian Statistics book (p12) on Hathi.
I'm using the data to create a toy application for learning how to get and clean data, create and use a SQL database, and use relevant software.
My blog (it's an Observable Notebook) documents my "workflow" -- a fancy name for trying to figure it out.
Comments welcome!
